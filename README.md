# libshard
A simple utility library written in C for Linux.

### How to install
To compile the library, simply type `make` into a shell and then type `sudo make install`. 

### How to use the library
Just include `shard/libshard.h` in your program. To compile a program using the library, use `-lshard` with gcc. You can also compile the example program (`test.c`) with those instructions. It demonstrates some basic features of the library. Currently, the library only provides a function for reading files, but more will come, and when I have time so will a wiki documenting the library.
